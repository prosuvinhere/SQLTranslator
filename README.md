# SQLSpeak

SQLSpeak is a sophisticated system designed to convert human language queries into SQL statements, enabling users to retrieve data from a database effortlessly. This project leverages advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques to bridge the gap between human language and structured database queries.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding:** Converts user input in plain English to precise SQL queries.

- **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Executes the generated SQL queries on the database to fetch the required data.

- **Semantic Similarity:** Uses semantic similarity for better understanding and interpretation of user queries.

- **Embeddings and Vector Stores:** Utilizes advanced embeddings and vector stores for accurate and efficient query processing.

## Tech Stack

**Language Model:**

- **Google Palm:** Handles natural language processing and     understanding.
**Database Utility:**

- **SQLDatabase (LangChain):** Facilitates interaction with the SQL database.
**Chain for SQL Queries:**

- **SQLDatabaseChain (LangChain):** Manages the conversion process from natural language to SQL queries.

**Example Selector:**

**SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector (LangChain):** Enhances query understanding by selecting relevant examples based on semantic similarity.

**Embeddings:**

**HuggingFaceEmbeddings:** Provides high-quality embeddings for natural language understanding.

**Vector Store:**

**Chroma:** Stores and retrieves vector representations of text for efficient query processing.

**Prompt Templates:**

- **FewShotPromptTemplate (LangChain):** Utilized for few-shot learning in prompt engineering.
- **PromptTemplate (LangChain):** Custom templates for prompt creation.

**Custom Prompts:**

- **PROMPT_SUFFIX:** Tailored suffix for prompts.
- **_mysql_prompt:** Specific prompt designed for MySQL database interactions.
## How It Works ##

**User Input:** The user inputs a query in natural language.

**Processing:** The input is processed using Google Palm to understand the intent and context.

**Query Conversion:** The processed input is converted into a SQL query using SQLDatabaseChain and other LangChain components.

**Data Retrieval:** The generated SQL query is executed against the database using SQLDatabase, and the results are fetched.

**Response:** The retrieved data is presented to the user in a readable format.


# Hi, I'm Suvin! üëã
Former Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corporation Intern | B.Tech in Computer Science (VIT Vellore) | Skills: LLM, DSA, MERN, AWS

## üöÄ About Me
I am a B.Tech Computer Science student at VIT Vellore with a CGPA of 8.5+. I am passionate about exploring new technologies and am dedicated to excelling in this rapidly evolving field.

During my internship at TMEIC, I developed a chatbot for IT support using Large Language Models (LLM). Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning, our goal was to create an intelligent chatbot capable of handling various IT support queries. This project provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in AI and deepened my understanding of natural language processing techniques.

I recently achieved the AWS Certified Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate (AWS SAA) certification, marking a significant milestone in my career. This certification demonstrates my expertise in designing distributed systems on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and I'm excited to leverage it to further my career in cloud computing.

I'm skilled in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, covering both frontend and backend development. I'm excited to leverage this expertise to create innovative web solutions.
